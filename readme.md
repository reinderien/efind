This is a simple script to propose component values from the 
[E-series of preferred numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_series_of_preferred_numbers)
that, when implemented in an electronic system defined by the script user,
introduce as little error as possible.

This script is:
- dumb
- simple
- exhaustive in most ways
- without a user interface; the definitions are supplied by the user, in their
  own script
  
  
Environmental dependencies: [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).

Known bugs: none; see [issues](https://github.com/reinderien/efind/issues) 
  
`efind.py` is itself reasonably documented, but you're best to read through
`examples.py`  for typical usage.
